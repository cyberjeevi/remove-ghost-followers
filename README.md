## How to
- If you have more than 200 posts you will get **rate limited**
- Script uses slightly modified [instabot](https://github.com/ohld/igbot) as the interface
  - The only change is a different access to the `remove_follower` function
- Either install via `pip install instabot` and replace file from `2replace` directory
- Or download the ready to use `.exe` from [here](http://bit.ly/remove-ghosts-releases)

## Whitelist
- When adding users to `whitelist.txt` **use IDs instead of usernames**
- You can find user's ID [here](https://codeofaninja.com/tools/find-instagram-user-id/)
